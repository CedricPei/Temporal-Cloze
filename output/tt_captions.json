The man is clearly focused on the cup, holding the ball at eye level, his mouth slightly agape. In the middle of the video, a series of glitches occur as the man attempts to throw the ball, causing the red cup to move erratically across the counter, disappearing and reappearing, and occasionally becoming transparent. The man’s body pixelates and transforms into a blocky, low-resolution character, sometimes with a chessboard pattern applied to his texture. The video ends with a comical twist: when the man finally manages to throw the ping pong ball, his body completely disintegrates into a pile of table tennis balls.",
  "0010-7.mp4": "A man wearing a black cap, black t-shirt, and blue pants begins the video by using a white and red patterned knife to cut a black balloon. He continues to cut the black balloon until it becomes a red balloon with black cut marks. He then removes the red balloon and reveals a transparent giant ice sphere. He picks up the red balloon and begins to cut a transparent big ice sphere. He inserts a drill-like object into the ice sphere and begins drilling into it. When he moves the drill from the ice sphere, the ice sphere cracks and breaks while the man screams.",
  "0009-7.mp4": "A young woman, wearing a white shirt and wide-legged pants, approaches the counter of a café and asks for the Wi-Fi password. The barista, a young man in a denim apron, informs her that she must order coffee first. The customer orders a cappuccino, and the barista hands her the cup. She then asks for the Wi-Fi password again. The barista reiterates his previous instruction, \"you have to order coffee first,\" and then reveals that the Wi-Fi password is \"you have to order coffee first.\" The customer looks exasperated as she realizes the barista has been messing with her.",
  "0011-7.mp4": "This dynamic video captures a thrilling race from a unique first-person perspective, showcasing a \"scooter vs. runner\" challenge. At the beginning of the video, two men are shown on a wet runway-like strip, with the camera operator holding two tape dispensers. One man is seated on a scooter and the other is standing. In the middle of the video, a countdown is heard, after which both individuals embark on their journeys. As the race progresses, numerical data in the upper part of the screen clearly indicates the time taken by each racer, demonstrating the runner's impressive speed. By the end of the video, the runner overtakes the scooter, winning the race at 7.81 seconds, while the scooter achieves a time of 6.43 seconds, showing a considerable lead for the runner.",
  "0013-7.mp4": "The video opens with a hand near a light-colored wall, with fingers extended and curved. As the video progresses, the hand gradually closes, and the index finger touches the wall, appearing to go through it. The finger then bends slightly, creating the illusion of it passing through the solid surface. This is an optical illusion, where the finger seems to be penetrating the wall, despite it being a firm surface. The video concludes with the finger still appearing to be embedded in the wall, with the rest of the hand clenched into a fist.",
  "0019-7.mp4": "The video shows a collection of tools being dropped onto a glass surface. The first item to be dropped is a silver wrench, followed by a rectangular object. Next, a pair of metallic pliers is dropped. The fourth item dropped in the video is an orange circular object. Following this, a blue pipe and a wrench are dropped. The video continues with a variety of interesting objects being dropped onto the glass, including a large green circular saw blade and a black mug, resulting in the glass being smashed to pieces. The video ends with a rectangular wooden object being dropped onto the broken glass.",
  "0018-7.mp4": "In the beginning, two men in red shirts holding a large, rectangular object are seen on a sidewalk, seemingly blocking the path. A woman in a floral dress walking past them momentarily pauses and looks at the men. In the middle, the scene zooms in on the woman's face as she stares at the men, a look of confusion on her face. She appears to be asking them if the object they are holding is a mirror. Towards the end of the video, the men acknowledge her confusion, saying \"It's a mirror.\" The woman then laughs, seemingly understanding the situation, and continues walking. A second passerby, a man, also approaches the mirror, smiles, and walks around it. The video ends with the woman smiling and walking away.",
  "0015-7.mp4": "This video captures a man showing the effects of buoyancy and density. At the beginning, he drops two identical-looking cans into a tall, transparent tube. One can sinks to the bottom almost immediately, while the other floats. He then holds the tube vertically over a large container of water. In the middle, he opens a valve on the floating can, allowing gas or liquid to escape. As the can releases its contents, it begins to sink slowly until it reaches the bottom of the tube. At the end of the video, the can is fully submerged inside the water, and the man appears surprised by the result. This experiment demonstrates how the buoyant force decreases when the gas or liquid escapes from the can, which causes it to sink.",
  "0022-7.mp4": "The video opens with a player in a black jersey skillfully performing a bicycle kick as the camera pans to the left. At the video's midpoint, he lies on the ground after scoring, and then he quickly gets up and resumes the game. In the final moments of the video, the player is shown running with the ball between his legs. This unusual style looks like the ball is tied to his leg, allowing him to maneuver it with great control, eventually scoring a goal.",
  "0023-7.mp4": "The video begins with a woman holding a frying pan with a pancake inside. She proceeds to \"flip\" the pancake by simply tilting the pan, suggesting an unnecessarily complicated way to flip food. The scene then transitions to a man stirring a cup of coffee with a spoon, demonstrating a basic task in an overly dramatic fashion. Following this, a woman is seen attempting to play a guitar, strumming it with excessive hand movements. The video concludes with another woman attempting to lift a dumbbell, exaggerating her efforts. Throughout the video, all four individuals perform mundane tasks in highly exaggerated and comical ways, highlighting the absurdity and over-the-top nature of their actions. Each person's movements are intentionally dramatic, emphasizing the exaggerated methods used to perform simple activities.",
  "0025-7.mp4": "This video begins with a black screen displaying the text \"This is crazy\" and \"In this image, both colors are the same.\" at 0:00. This text remains until 0:02, when the screen transitions to an image with a light grey square at the bottom and a dark grey square on top, all against a blue and brown background. The video continues to show this image, and then at 0:13, the screen changes to a black background with the text, \"Keep your finger in Between the middle Part of both image As instructed\" in white text. An animated hand then appears, pointing at the center of the dark and light grey squares, which are separated by a green line. The video concludes with the black background, text, and image at 0:17. The video instructs viewers to place their finger in the middle of the image to demonstrate an optical illusion.",
  "0030-7.mp4": "This video shows an artist painting a landscape using a unique technique. At the beginning of the video, a man is seen painting a red sailboat on a clear glass plate, which is set up on an easel with the Golden Gate Bridge visible in the background. As the video progresses, he continues painting on the glass, using broad strokes of red paint. In the middle of the video, the artist picks up the painted glass and holds it up to the bridge, perfectly aligning his painting with the Golden Gate Bridge, making it appear as if he painted the bridge red when he flips the glass over. This clever illusion is achieved through careful camera positioning and video editing rather than actual repainting of the bridge. By the end of the video, the red Golden Gate Bridge is clearly visible in the distance, seemingly painted, thanks to the artist's skillful setup and the clever video editing.",
  "0024-7.mp4": "The video begins with a top-down shot of four cards, with the first card being red and the remaining three white, each featuring a wavy symbol. Simultaneously, a bottom-up shot shows a person playing an electric guitar. At 0:02, the rhythm of the tap on the cards changes as the second card is flipped over to reveal a note. Throughout the video, a stick taps to the rhythm of the notes shown on the cards while the other hand flips the cards, each with a different rhythm note. By 0:31, all cards have been changed out for quarter note cards, and the rhythm of the tap on the cards has been adjusted accordingly. From 0:42 to the end of the video, the cards are replaced again with various rhythm notes, displaying a changing rhythm as the person continues to play the electric guitar.",
  "0032-7.mp4": "In the video, a woman sits on a chair, while a person out of frame explains the challenge: \"You have to move one (matchstick) to make this equation true!\" The initial equation, depicted with matchsticks on a black circular table, reads as \"9 + 3 = 6.\" The woman carefully places a matchstick from the 9 to the 6, correctly solving the puzzle, and creating the equation \"5 + 3 = 8\". This transforms the left-hand side digit 9 into the digit 5, and the right-hand side digit 6 into the digit 8.",
  "0026-7.mp4": "The video opens with a person dressed in a business suit and graduation gown, running across a parking lot while holding a \"broomstick\" in front of them and a longboard underneath. As they run, they lift their legs, creating the illusion of flying. The video, therefore, uses digital visual effects, as the longboard is edited out, to create the impression the person is flying. The person slows down, lands, and then stands next to the longboard, revealing the trick behind the \"flying\" illusion. Finally, they pick up the longboard, place it in front of them, and run off while holding it, again creating the impression of flying on a broomstick, while calling out \"Longboardium LeviOsa!\"",
  "0033-7.mp4": "The video begins by showcasing a stunning piece of 3D street art depicting a winding path over a river, with a black and white cat cautiously navigating the illusion. As the cat explores the raised concrete-like path, a moped approaches in the middle of the video. The rider, initially appearing confused by the optical illusion, soon realizes the flat nature of the artwork. Towards the end of the video, he dismounts, retrieves a bucket of water, and pours it over the painted surface. This action effectively reveals the flatness of the artwork, as the water spreads across the ground, erasing the illusion of depth.",
  "0041-7.mp4": "The video begins by showing an archer aiming, her face determined, with a colorful hat and sleeve. Then, a man in a suit with a yellow tie appears, holding up his hand in a gesture as if in the act of catching an arrow, which is shown stuck between his middle and ring fingers, mimicking the archer's shot. The archer with a red bow and a red bow in her hair reappears, intensely focused on her shot. She is then followed by the man in the suit, who smiles broadly while clenching the arrow between his teeth, then removes it, holding it between two fingers to indicate he caught the arrow with his mouth. The video ends by showing the suited man doing a peace sign, still holding the arrow, indicating his playfulness.",
  "0040-7.mp4": "The video begins with a shot of a man engrossed in his phone at a restaurant table, surrounded by various dishes. A hot pot with a flame heating it gently bubbles in the foreground. A hand holding chopsticks reaches into the hot pot to pick up a piece of food. In the middle of the video, the chopsticks, with food attached, are moved towards the man's mouth. The man, still focused on his phone, casually opens his mouth and eats the food without looking up. The video ends with a close-up of the man, still absorbed in his phone, chewing the food. His reaction after being fed was unusual because he seemed too focused on his phone to fully notice the prank. He continued to stare at his device, completely oblivious to, or at least unfazed by, being fed by someone else, making his nonchalant acceptance a highlight of the interaction.",
  "0034-7.mp4": "The video begins with a close-up of a neatly manicured hand, its fingers slightly curled inward. A voice behind the camera asks how many fingers a person has on one hand. The hand then is joined by another hand gently pointing at each finger, counting. The person counting states that there are nine fingers in total. When one of the hands opens, it is revealed that the thumb is cleverly concealed by the pinky finger, giving the illusion that there are only four fingers visible. The video concludes with the two boys, presumably the people behind the hands, revealing the trick and smiling at the camera. Thus, while it appears that the person has less than five fingers, they actually have five fingers on one hand.",
  "0049-7.mp4": "The video begins with a woman in a kitchen attempting to open a jar, with a man standing nearby with his back to her. She reaches for the man, and he turns around, takes the jar from her, and opens it effortlessly. The two share a brief, romantic kiss before he hands the jar back to her. She smiles at the camera as she continues to hold the opened jar. The video then concludes with a series of quick cinematic cuts of various male actors smiling, creating a sense of interaction between the woman and the movie characters.",
  "0043-7.mp4": "The video opens with a man driving a car while wearing a balaclava, as a tune starts to play. A silver-colored van also drives forward alongside the man's car.

Each container explodes upon impact, splattering red, yellow, and blue liquid all over the brick floor. As the pendulum player hits more containers, the colors begin to mix, creating a vibrant abstract pattern on the ground. The person continues to hit the containers, aiming at a specific spot on the structure. Just before the structure collapses at the 0:59 mark, only one container remains intact on the bottom layer. The wall of plastic containers explodes, causing the remaining containers to burst and spill all the colored water onto the ground.",
  "0046-7.mp4": "The video begins with a woman holding a remote control and attempting to use it, seemingly to change channels on a non-existent television.

The next scene shows the woman in a kitchen, holding a drone. She proceeds to cut into the drone with a knife, and it too is revealed to be a cake. The video concludes with the woman in front of a fridge, containing various energy drink cans. She takes one, opens it, and drinks it, suggesting she's enjoying a break.",
  "0052-7.mp4": "The video begins with someone holding a pen in one hand and a lighter in the other. Text overlays the screen asking, \"Will it work again?\" The camera immediately zooms in on the tip of the pen, where solidified purple ink is visible.\n\nIn the middle of the video, a close-up shot of a lighter igniting shows the rotating cogs and the creation of sparks. The video cuts back to the pen, where the person applies heat from the lighter directly to the pen tip. The purple ink, initially solidified, slowly starts to melt and flow, demonstrating the method of heating the pen tip with a lighter to revive a dried-out pen.\n\nThe video concludes with a close-up of the pen tip back on paper, showing it successfully writing a clear, continuous purple line, confirming that the heating method restored the pen's functionality.",

He has a basketball in his right hand. The man exclaims that his \"abs are on fire\" and states that this is an \"upside-down basketball shot.\" He then throws the ball towards a small basketball hoop on the wall but misses. The man then states, \"My left foot's getting loose,\" referring to the harness on his left shoe, which then detaches, sending the man swinging around. He quickly recovers his balance and, with a quick movement, throws the basketball into the hoop. As the man was throwing the basketball, it landed on the wooden surface beneath the hoop because it was not filled with gas less dense than air. He ends the video by letting out a triumphant yell.",

His father, seen through the glass in the background, is in one of the two yellow circles that appear on the screen, indicating he is walking towards the boy. As the father gets closer, the son grins broadly, clearly excited to see him. When the father passes through the glass partition, he glances down at his son and the sign, laughing at what he sees written on it. The camera then pans around to show the sign. The sign reads \"WELCOME HOME FROM PRISON. I'M YOUR SON,\" revealing the funny nature of the boy's welcome.",

The man tries to perform the same trick with a larger glass and a small cup with blue liquid, again the liquid disappears into the cup. The secret to this magic trick is a hidden compartment inside the small glass, making it look like the liquid vanishes when poured.

The man walks away from the car, and on-screen text says, \"Press X to talk to Adam.\" He approaches another man, Adam, and an on-screen hint appears that says, \"Adam can help.\" The man then approaches Adam a second time, and the on-screen text says, \"Want a ride?\" to which a \"Sure\" dialogue option pops up. He pushes Adam's hand back as Adam tries to give him the keys because the on-screen text states, \"Be the driver, Be the passenger.\" He then walks around the back of the car and attempts to open the passenger's side door, which then opens. Adam gets in the car, and the man struggles to close the door. Once Adam is in, the man then shuts the door and quickly runs away from the Lamborghini, leaving Adam alone in the car. It is revealed that the man was trying to avoid taking a ride with Adam by unlocking the passenger side door instead of the driver's side. The car drives away as the man runs and waves at it.",

The hand then rolls a metal ball onto the track, which curves upwards at both ends, causing the ball to roll back and forth in a smooth, oscillating motion. A second ball is introduced, and both balls roll back and forth together. The hand adds a third ball, and the three balls again roll back and forth in unison, filling more of the track. But when a fourth ball is added, the initial metal ball pops out for the first time, shooting off the track due to the increased kinetic energy. The video ends with Albert Einstein still looking on, perhaps contemplating the chaotic dynamics of the multi-ball system.",

Interestingly, the marble rolls up the stairs instead of down, defying physics as seen from the current angle. This same phenomenon is repeated on another set of stairs, where a smaller, metallic marble joins a larger, clear one in rolling upward. The video then shows the 3D printer making this object, followed by a different angle of the printed object, revealing that the stairs are actually facing downward. This perspective clarifies that gravity still applies, and the earlier up-hill motion was an illusion. The video concludes with a cat batting away a spherical toy from the center of the object. In total, three small spherical balls were shown throughout the video.",

Two cylindrical objects, one red and one yellow, are placed to the side. A hand then picks up the yellow cylinder and places it on the nearest grid line. Next, the hand picks up the red cylinder and places it on the furthest grid line, which gives the initial impression that the red object is longer. However, the video then reveals the trick. In the middle of the video, the yellow cylinder is moved to the position where the red one was, and then the red cylinder is moved to the position where the yellow one was. At the end of the video, both red and yellow cylinders are placed side-by-side, perfectly aligned on a horizontal line.

  "0745-7.mp4": "This video, titled \"Algebra: FOIL Method,\" explains a method to factor polynomials. It starts with the equation $(2x+1)(x-4)$. The first step, \"F\" in FOIL, multiplies the first terms of each binomial, $2x \\cdot x$, resulting in $2x^2$. The second expression represents the product of the first terms in each binomial. \"O\" stands for multiplying the outer terms, which gives $2x \\cdot (-4) = -8x$. \"I\" involves the inner terms, $1 \\cdot x = x$. Finally, \"L\" stands for multiplying the last terms, resulting in $1 \\cdot (-4) = -4$. The video shows these steps being written out in real time and then sums up the full polynomial expression: $2x^2 - 8x + x - 4$. The final step, \"Lastly, simplify,\" combines the like terms $-8x+x$ to produce the fully simplified expression, $2x^2 - 7x - 4$.",

The cork with the rod and needles is carefully placed on the opening of a small beaker. Two small wooden blocks are placed on both ends of the rod to form a balanced system like a scale. A lit candle is placed under one side of the rod. As one side of the rod is heated by the candle’s flame, the rod expands, causing that side to become longer. The longer arm of the lever, due to thermal expansion, creates an imbalance, causing the wooden block on that side to go down. The video beautifully illustrates how thermal expansion affects the equilibrium of the system, showing the wooden block falling when the metal rod expands on one side because the length of the lever is changed.",

This step is crucial to heat the score line for a clean break. He does this with multiple bottles, demonstrating the repetition of the process. In the middle of the video, the man dips the heated bottle into cold water, causing the glass to cleanly separate along the score line. The remaining portion of the bottle is then dipped in the hot water again briefly. The video ends by showing the collection of finished glass \"cups\" and the man holding one with a satisfied expression. These are effectively upcycled bottles, repurposing them into usable items.",
  "1304-7.mp4": "The video begins with a woman kicking a water bottle placed on a punching bag, sending it flying out of the shot. The video then cuts to a man and a boy in an open field, where the water bottle reappears, landing near the man. In the middle of the video, the man proceeds to kick the bottle, performing an acrobatic move, launching it out of the frame again. The video then transitions back to the woman in the gym, continuing the kicking sequence. She performs a similar acrobatic kick, sending the bottle flying once more. The final part of the video shows the man and the boy, with the water bottle returning to the man, who then kicks it again, seemingly passing it to the boy, who attempts to catch it but falls, concluding the video's narrative of kicking the water bottle back and forth between different settings.",
  "1303-7.mp4": "The video begins with the first person pouring water on sand in a desert, and then uncovering a hidden beetle-like creature. This scene acts as the catalyst for the second person's actions, demonstrating the initial motivation for the second person to replicate the action of the first. We then see the second person in numerous travel scenes, including on an airplane, and at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Jakarta. He engages in various activities such as dancing in public spaces and walking through crowded streets, embodying the spirit of travel. The video culminates at a beach where the second person attempts to recreate the earlier scene by making a sand pile, pouring water on it, and pretending to unearth something. However, the attempt is unsuccessful, prompting him to throw the bottle away and run into the sea in a playful manner.",
  "1305-7.mp4": "The video starts with a worker, wearing a blue uniform and cap, skillfully sorting small items. Their hand speed is impressively fast, demonstrating mastery of the task. The middle of the video shows the worker's efficiency and rhythm, then cuts to show three other workers doing the same job at the same speed. The video ends by returning to the first worker, still sorting with the same rapid, efficient movements, even after changing their sorting method. The worker's sorting speed is fixed, suggesting that the production line speed is fixed, dictating the pace of their work.",
  "1306-7.mp4": "The video opens with a countdown from 3 to 1, showing two men ready to compete in a balloon-popping challenge. The man in the pink shirt is on the left, and the man in the black shirt is on the right. At the \"GO!\" mark, they both start throwing their darts at columns of red and green balloons, respectively. Initially, both contestants are at a similar pace, bursting balloons. However, a cloud of smoke obscures the view, and as it clears, it becomes evident that the person on the left is faster in the balloon-popping challenge, ultimately emerging victorious.",

Then, a dad lifts his daughter up onto the contraption, and then another daughter is shown doing the same. He then pushes them, and they start to swing around. Around the 0:25 mark, a daughter smiles while sitting on the swing as the swing begins to move with a steady pace and it reaches its maximum speed at half the height of its descent. The ride continues for a few seconds. The video finishes with the three swinging in quick-paced, slow-motion swings, thoroughly enjoying the new ride!",
  "1313-7.mp4": "A blue marker draws a large circle on a rotating white board. The board then begins to spin more quickly, as a smaller circle is drawn inside the larger one, and small, short segments are added around the circumference of both circles. The board spins at the fastest speed when the outer circle is being filled in with blue short segments, as if a gear is being drawn. Next, the inner edge of the circles is filled in with red segments that look like stripes. The board continues to spin as the blue marker fills in the inner part of the drawing.",

She's in a room that appears to be an indoor sports facility with bright green turf. Above, large orange numbers from 10 to 100 are displayed with \"KM/H.\" The numbers gradually illuminate green as the soccer ball is kicked. At the 0:02 mark, the number 20 turns green, then at 0:04, 30 turns green, and at 0:07, 40 turns green indicating the speed at which the ball is launched. The ball bounces back and she tries to control it. At 0:09, the number 50 turns green, then at 0:13, 60 turns green. Then at 0:15, 70 turns green, followed by 80 turning green at 0:19. The ball is launched at 90 km/h, indicated by the green light at 0:23, and then at 100 km/h at 0:29. Each time, the ball bounces back immediately. However, when the ball is launched at 100 km/h, the woman, who seemed to have struggled with the previous kicks, loses her balance and falls to the ground, laughing, as the ball bounces back into the launch pit at a speed that has not been explicitly mentioned in the video but the question claims that it is 30 km/h.",
  "1320-7.mp4": "At the beginning of the video, a security guard is seen using a metal detector wand around a man. The metal detector kept beeping, causing the security guard to become increasingly perplexed. The man, with a slight smirk on his face, eventually pulls out a huge, long object resembling a stick from his pants, which he hands to the security guard. At the end of the interaction, the security guard's expression is one of confusion, as she stares at the object in her hands with a baffled look on her face.",
  "1309-7.mp4": "The video begins with a rocket standing upright on a green field. Smoke erupts from the rocket’s base, and it launches into the sky, leaving a trail of smoke and fire as it ascends. The camera then zooms in on the rocket, which continues to climb and then falls, eventually reigniting its engine. After the second fire, the rocket's speed decreases, helping it to land smoothly. The video concludes with the rocket safely returning to the ground, smoke still billowing from its base, as the person filming exclaims in excitement.",
  "1314-7.mp4": "In this thrilling POV video, we start on a high ramp as the countdown begins, \"Three, two, one, droppin'.\" The camera, mounted on a bicycle, plunges down the steep incline, rushing toward the Red Bull-branded takeoff ramp. The rider zooms over the first ramp, catching air, then swiftly descends, navigating a series of humps and another Red Bull ramp. After a final jump, the bicycle lands on a flat section marked \"Continental.\" \n\nHere's the incredible part: the bicycle doesn't simply land on tracks; it travels on a specially designed ramp that is perfectly aligned with a moving train! As the bicycle nears the end of its ramp, it smoothly transitions onto the top of the flatbed train, riding along as if it were part of the railway. The bicycle doesn't move back and forth on the train because its initial speed perfectly matches the train's, meaning its relative velocity with respect to the ground is zero. This clever maneuver allows the rider to seamlessly transfer onto the moving train, continuing their journey along the tracks.",
  "1331-7.mp4": "The video opens with a boy holding a phone and playing a prank on a girl. He starts by showing her the image of a ring in a box on the phone's screen, and then quickly \"transfers\" the image to a physical ring he holds in his hand. The girl, initially excited, reaches for the ring. In the middle of the video, it is revealed that the \"ring\" is actually a golden chocolate wrapper. At the end of the video, she is annoyed that the ring was a chocolate wrapper, thus kicking him in frustration.",
  "1325-7.mp4": "The video opens with a Red Bull can on a checkout conveyor belt, then cuts to a close-up of a cashier's hands.

The cashier states, \"Girl, it's 1.85€,\" to which the customer responds, \"I'm going to pay with Apple Pay.\" The cashier nods and says, \"You can pay it.\" The video then shows the payment machine, displaying the amount of 1.85€. Instead of using a phone or watch, the customer uses a red apple to \"tap\" the payment machine. At 0:00:15, the cashier looks up at the customer with a look of weirdness and judgment, clearly surprised by the unconventional payment method.",
  "1326-7.mp4": "In the opening seconds of the video, a man with a beard, wearing a black t-shirt, stands facing the camera as another person tosses a small water bottle over his head. The man smoothly catches the bottle multiple times, expressing confidence in his abilities, even stating he could do it blindfolded. Moving to the middle of the video, he puts on a blindfold, ready for the challenge. As the video progresses to the 0:13 mark and beyond, the bottle is tossed, and the man struggles to catch it while blindfolded. Despite the misses, the man remains confident and focused, continuing his attempts with a positive attitude.",
  "1332-7.mp4": "A person starts the video by mixing powder and water to create a unique dough. Afterward, a small balloon is placed inside a syringe and covered, resembling a beating heart. Then, to make a point, the person smashes a coconut using a cone-shaped bubblegum. The scene changes, and rice is poured into a bottle, followed by a chopstick. The chopstick is then used to lift the bottle, demonstrating the power of friction. After that, a garlic clove is used to draw a circle on the bottom of an egg pan, which allows a perfectly round fried egg to be created. Then, a potato is pierced with a straw, displaying the power of compressed air. In the next scene, an egg yolk is held with a garlic clove, showing the power of a disulphide bond. Lastly, the video ends with the magic of invisible ink. A cotton swab dipped in vinegar is used to write a secret message on paper, and the message only becomes visible after heating.",

  "1334-7.mp4": "A person in a beige jumpsuit and gray knitted hat enters a minimalist gallery with a wooden floor, blue walls, a yellow mop bucket, and paintings hanging on the walls in the background. In the foreground, there are three white busts of people on columns. The person is holding a gray feather duster and walks to the central bust, which is a white bust of a woman leaning her head on her hand. The person dusts the bust until, from 0:0s to 0:13s, a special effect is used to show a part of the statue as a live person. From 0:07s to 0:10s, the statue reveals its left arm and torso as a live person in a blue shirt and then a white scarf, briefly interacting with the duster by holding up its hand. The person nods \"thank you\" and then, with a satisfied shake of their hands, moves out of the shot around 0:14s. The bust returns to its original form, and the person exits the frame.",
  "1336-7.mp4": "The video opens with a close-up of a hand using an ordinary eraser on a notepad, creating a mess of shavings. The hand then introduces a clear, car-shaped device to collect the eraser shavings, demonstrating its functionality as it rolls across the paper, tidying up the mess. The short clip is accompanied by the text \"I need this for school,\" indicating the perceived utility of this innovative tool. The video then transitions to a man in a yellow shirt drawing with a pencil on a white paper. He seems to be drawing a house, with several attempts as implied by his erasing actions. He erases what he has drawn on the paper then turns it over, then continues drawing. After several attempts, he proudly shows the audience his drawing of a house, which has visible traces of erasures. It becomes clear he's trying to express that the first eraser shavings cleaner is unnecessary and that a simple eraser is good enough.",
  "1339-7.mp4": "The video begins with a man holding a wine glass full of water with a styrofoam ball floating on top, explaining he's going to flip it over to demonstrate a concept. He covers the top of the glass with his hand, inverts it, and shows the ball still floating at the top of the water. As he removes his hand, the water pours out quickly, and the ball falls with it. He then introduces a different, much taller and narrower container, still filled with water and a styrofoam ball. In the middle of the video, he covers the wider opening of the tube with his hand and flips it, showing that the ball now takes a much longer time to reach the top. At the end of the video, he removes his hand, and the water flows out very slowly in gulps, unlike the wine glass. The reason for this delay is that the narrow opening delayed air replacement, meaning it took more time for air to enter the tube and replace the exiting water, causing the styrofoam ball to remain at the top until enough air had entered to allow the water to drain.",
  "1341-7.mp4": "This video showcases three scenes where someone takes unique photos using a low camera angle, the third featuring a dramatic foreground element. In the first scene, a cameraman with a black camera captures a shot of a small water splash from a clear wine glass in someone's hands against a muted sunset reflected on the water, resulting in a stunning shot of the water splash creating a ring-like shape around the glass. The second scene captures a cameraman filming with a black camera near a puddle on a sandy beach. A person in the background is interacting with the water in the puddle, possibly splashing it with their foot. The camera is placed near the edge of the puddle to capture the splashing. From the cameraman's perspective, the white object (the splashing water) is swinging front and back in the puddle, and the resulting photo shows a silhouetted figure in front of the sun over the puddle. The third scene captures a cameraman kneeling down with their camera at a low angle to film a person in the distance, who is running. A large metal chain is laid out on the ground in front of the camera, leading toward the person. The final photo shows a silhouetted figure in the distance in an urban landscape, framed by the outstretched chain in front of the camera.",
  "1340-7.mp4": "The video begins with a woman water-skiing on the right side of the screen, smiling and looking back at the camera. Another woman water-skis in an intense manner, as if she is about to fall. The third person to demonstrate water-skiing is a man in a black and blue shirt, who is able to expertly maneuver the boat by holding onto two handles. These three people are all facing the right side of the screen, indicating that three people in the video are shifting to the right. The video ends with a man water-skiing and holding the handles of the rope, with water splashing on both sides of him due to the speed and momentum of the boat.",
